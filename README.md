## Description
Bilkonnekt is a platform exclusive to Bilkenters. It is more than a local marketplace app. It also offers social and academic services. Bilkonnekt is designed to become an integral part of every Bilkenter's life. Bilkenters can sell their second-hand goods on this platform. They can also borrow and lend their stuff and donate their old things to the ones in need. There is a lost and found section where the lost items are listed by the ones who found them so that whenever a Bilkenter loses something, they can be notified quickly and don't have to search dozens of Instagram pages. There is an academic section for students to find group members for their projects and swap sections. Bilkonnekt is not only for students though; professors can communicate with staff and tell their requests in an organized and structured way. Also, for fun, there is a social section where people can share their crazy stories and try to find the love of their life with posts similar to social media. Students can also get information about clubs and events.


The use of a unique Bilkent email address is essential to fully utilize Bilkonnekt's features, such as selling second-hand items, borrowing books, or donating a scientific calculator. Nevertheless, anyone connected to Bilkent University wifi connections can browse items in the marketplace or explore available course groups without logging in. Bilkenters come across their home page after successfully logging in. They can travel to the marketplace, bilkent social, and bilkent academic from their home page with quick links.  


All of this will result in a web app that has competent marketplace features complemented by useful academic features for both the students and the faculty. As well as a social feed connecting students and student clubs. All of these features in the same web app mean that users can find most of their needs in Bilkent satisfied by a convenient platform for the first time. 


Watch for future updates and additional features!



## Motivation and Goals

Bilkonnekt is a database-driven web application that is a social marketplace. Bilkent community can use Bilkonnekt to meet their social and professional needs such as second-hand sales, borrowing, donations, and reporting lost and found items. Also, users can make use of some academic and social features without having to use any other platform.


The motivation behind this web application is to create a welcoming space where Bilkent community members can find solutions to their needs, be it facilitating the transactional procedure or participating in the social aspect of campus life in a structured and convenient way.


The goals of our web app include gathering important transactional and social needs of Bilkent members in one place so that Bilkent members have a dedicated place specifically to address those needs. In addition to facilitating transactions within the Bilkent community, we want to create a space where users will be able to stay up-to-date on student club activities, and form study and project groups with the functionality of assigning and monitoring tasks to their group members.



## Features: 


### 1) Second-Hand Sales

In our web app, there will be a second-hand sales feature where Bilkent members can sell their goods such as course books, course materials, and so on to other Bilkent members who are willing to buy them. With this feature, both the seller and buyer will benefit. Because the seller can find a buyer easily. After all, it is likely that the buyer has the same course that semester. The buyer will also be advantageous because of the nature of second-hand sales, where it will be much cheaper than buying the same good brand new.


In our implementation of the sale feature, there will be an honor system that will function by showing a percentage rate of successful transactions that the user completed to indicate to sellers and buyers the integrity of the other party in the transaction. This feature will help transactions feel more trustworthy for both the seller and for buyers.


### 2) Borrowing

This feature enables people to borrow and retrieve their items without any transaction. Since members of the Bilkent community generally share certain needs, Bilkent members can likely need some other members' products. Vice-versa, one may require an item for a course and another student will likely have it if they passed that same course before. With this feature, Bilkent community members can lend their items to other Bilkent members without selling them and retrieve them conveniently.


The borrowing system will also have an honor system. Users will have borrowing scores, when a borrower damages the borrowed item or does not return the item in the planned time, their borrowing score will be decreased and other users will be able to see each other's scores to avoid lending their items to unreliable people with low borrowing scores.


### 3) Lost and Found Items

Bilkent members can post the items that they found on campus in our web app to contact the person who lost their belongings. This feature makes Bilkent community members' lives easier by enabling them to directly find their lost items without losing time searching through other platforms or in real life.


In our implementation of this feature, we will put some limitations on the posts the user can make to indicate a lost or found item, such as not allowing pictures of lost items to prevent third parties from taking advantage of the system to steal a lost valuable item. Moreover, this feature will not utilize a feed structure and be more of a list of trackable processes as an itemized list which will update when the lost item is found.


### 4) Donations

Members of the Bilkent community can decide to donate their items to people who need them without any conditions, allowing anyone in the community to find and use what they need easily. In our implementation of this feature, we will allow users to apply to receive a donation item anonymously to reduce embarrassment to the users who want to receive some items that may be sensitive for the donation.


### 5) Bilkent Social (Extra Feature 1)


#### Clubs and Societies:

Clubs can share their posters and planned activities in this section. Users can track social activities easily and attend club activities. It aims to make students more socially connected and provides a place for students to do lots of things on a single website. Club executives can log in with their club information and will have a different role than the students. Only club executives will be able to post events and there will be profile pages for clubs so that the clubs can describe themselves and the activities they do in detail to all of the student body, which currently they cannot do, as they can only post their activities in their own spaces like WhatsApp groups and Instagram pages. This feature also allows all students to check and compare club events for a day in a convenient feature.


#### Feed:

Bilkent University's esteemed student body and academic staff have the opportunity to engage in meaningful discourse through the platform known as "Bilkent Social." This platform facilitates the exchange of ideas, enabling users to both express their viewpoints and engage with the perspectives of others. Furthermore, Bilkent Social incorporates a system of categorization through the use of tags, thereby promoting content organization and enhancing the user experience by allowing individuals to tailor their feed to their particular interests and preferences.


Upon selecting a post within the feed, a dedicated page is generated, showcasing the content in question. This feature permits users to contribute their insights and commentary to the discussion, fostering a sense of community around specific topics while maintaining a degree of anonymity. This design choice ensures that Bilkent Social serves as a robust platform for meaningful and constructive communication among its diverse user base.



### 6) Bilkent Academic (Extra Feature 2)


#### Establishing Study and Project Groups:

Bilkent University students can find groups for their projects in the academic section of the website. They can specify the qualities and skills they are seeking in a team member in the descriptions and users can request to join project groups with information about their qualifications. This enables students to effortlessly search for available groups without the need for inquiries in WhatsApp groups or searching teams on campus. Also, people looking for team members for their teams can choose the ideal team member for their project.


#### Arranged Section Swapping:

Students can arrange section changes within themselves by adding requests to drop or add sections, if there are students that accept this request the system will match the two students will then negotiate and may agree to swap their sections. 


#### Faculty-Staff Request Forum:

Faculty members currently use WhatsApp groups to request classroom maintenance from staff workers, our feature will allow faculty members to post a request in a structured, user-friendly interface where staff members can have an organized to-do list and faculty members can more easily monitor a request they posted. Rather than scrolling back through a WhatsApp group chat to find their request text. In this feature, both faculty members and staff workers can monitor the process of a request reliably and conveniently.



## Problems That Bilkonnekt Solves:

Currently, when Bilkent members want to sell second-hand items, borrow books, or even just gossip, they use existing platforms such as Bilkent_itiraf_ediyor in which there are irrelevant posts that prevent Bilkent members from finding posts that are relevant to their needs. Bilkonnekt will solve this problem by making the distinction between transactional needs and social platforms.


Also, Bilkent members generally need the things that are needed by other Bilkent members. To prevent Bilkent members from searching through their needs in other marketplaces, they can search for what they want to buy, borrow, and so on in Bilkonnekt without losing time on searching through other marketplaces which are full of other irrelevant items.


Another problem our web app solves that is the lack of socializing on the campus. Bilkent students often complain about the Bilkent’s busy schedule and lack of socializing opportunities. In contrast, there are lots of clubs that offer various rich activities that these students do not hear about. However, the unorganized nature of announcing club events by putting posters up in buildings where some posters are hidden by others and posters of past events share the same space means that a student has to do the work when they want to attend a specific poster. Moreover, posts on Instagram about club events only get shared with existing club members who have already chosen to see posts from that club. Bilkonnekt solves this problem by connecting more students with student clubs with its “Today in Bilkent” feature which allows club events to be shown to all students in an organized way. Clubs also enjoy access to the entire university student body through customized posters posted on the club page or through their dedicated club descriptions on Bilkonnekt. Unlike Instagram, Bilkonnekt provides a more effective platform for clubs and student societies, as their posts are not intermingled with unrelated content, and they have the opportunity to create a dedicated space for describing their club's mission and activities.


Bilkonnekt significantly enhances the visibility of club-related content by offering a private and focused platform for club activities. In contrast, Instagram often exposes users to outdated posters from past club activities, which may not be advantageous for clubs seeking to promote current events. Bilkonnekt goes beyond Instagram's capabilities by offering a dedicated space where users can explore and learn about various clubs and their ongoing activities. All of these design choices work towards fostering a sense of community and facilitate the discovery of diverse interests within the university.


Another problem that is going to be solved with this website is the staff-professor communications. Currently, when there is a program to be installed in a classroom or a desk to be fixed the professor writes it on a public WhatsApp group with lots of people inside it and when the related staff members see the post, they come and fix the problem. This makes it easy for staff members to miss some of the posts and generally hard to find their tasks. So, with the request forum, the professors are only chatting with the staff members that are assigned to do the tasks they requested and this will keep things organized and easy to track their progress.


Finally, finding project groups can be stressful for both project teams and people with no teams. Usually, these people send messages to WhatsApp groups, send messages to bilkent_itiraf_ediyor or they ask people in real life. Currently, no mechanism directly connects people who are looking for teams and teams who are looking for people. Also, one other problem is teams usually do not know the skills of their future team member and people with no team do not know the quality of the project teams they apply for. Bilkonnekt solves this problem by having a page that has the ads of the project teams for students with no project groups to apply to. On that page, project groups can write a description about what they need a team member for. And people who are looking for a project group can apply for a team that they will be happy to be a part of.


## Selling Points:

• No app or webpage exists where all of the features above are in the same place.

• Other features from our web app also provide a more intuitive way to reach information such as club activities for the day, whereas before students had to log in to SRS or go to the dedicated site to find a list of activities. But with Bilkonnekt students can find this information in a more approachable way.

• Establishing groups is a stressful process for both people looking for a team and teams looking for a team member. Bilkonnekt makes this process easier for both parties.


## Interesting Facts About Bilkonnekt:

• Amplified security with double JWT usage in authorization. Security risks are highly reduced with access and refresh token usage.

• The web app uses two-factor authentication, Bilkonnekt is exclusive for Bilkenters, and the sign-up system only accepts emails ending in bilkent.edu.tr.

• It is innovative for a social platform to have transactional, social, and academic features.

• Admins check shared posts to detect inappropriate content and users who are using this language will be banned.

• There will be a contact page where users can report bugs, offer new features, or just want to chat with developers.
